# Drone
# First time using Prolog
# By Joshua Meritt

This is a 2d simulation of a drone flying through a cave.
The cave is defined as an input before the program is run and the drone finds the shortest path through the cave.
Drone makes sure it does not hit any of the walls and stays within the cave.
